#### Challenges in Medical Imaging

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging holds great promise, but it also comes with several challenges that advancements in AI can help address. Here are some key challenges in medical imaging that can benefit from the progress of AI:

##### Interpretation Variability

-   **Challenge:** Different radiologists may interpret images differently, leading to variability in diagnoses.

Different radiologists may interpret images differently, leading to variability in diagnoses. This variability has been observed in various medical imaging studies. For instance, found variability in the interpretation of chest radiographs for the diagnosis of pneumonia in children[@neuman2011]. Similarly, demonstrated high inter-observer variability among radiologists' interpretations of thyroid nodules seen on US images[@buda2019]. Furthermore, highlighted variability in radiologists' reporting styles and recommendations for incidental thyroid nodules, which can lead to confusion among clinicians and inconsistent patient care[@grady2014]. Additionally, noted wide variability in mammographic interpretation by radiologists in both screening and diagnostic performance[@miglioretti2009]. These studies collectively indicate that the interpretation of medical images by radiologists can vary significantly, impacting the accuracy and consistency of diagnoses.

Moreover, the discrepancy rate between preliminary and official reports of emergency radiology studies has been identified as a performance indicator and a method for quality improvement[@issa2015]. This suggests that discrepancies in radiologists' interpretations can have implications for patient care and the overall quality of radiology services. Additionally, Nallapareddy and Ray emphasized the importance of identifying common patterns of misdiagnosis and discrepancy to refine the analysis of imaging studies and potentially reduce interpretive errors[@cohen2023]. This further underscores the significance of addressing variability in radiologists' interpretations to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Furthermore, the impact of experience and training on radiologists' interpretive skills has been highlighted. emphasized the need for a long period of medical training and clinical experience for radiologists to accurately interpret diagnostic images[@liu2021]. This suggests that factors such as experience and training may influence the variability in radiologists' interpretations.

In conclusion, the evidence from these studies supports the claim that different radiologists may interpret images differently, leading to variability in diagnoses. The variability in radiologists' interpretations of medical images has implications for patient care, diagnostic accuracy, and the overall quality of radiology services.

-   **AI Solution:** AI algorithms can provide consistent and objective image analysis, reducing variability and improving diagnostic accuracy.

AI algorithms have demonstrated the potential to provide consistent and objective image analysis, thereby reducing variability and improving diagnostic accuracy.

Additionally, Chandrashekhar et al.[@chandrashekhar2021] noted that stitching acquired fields of view into a complete volume is computation and time-intensive, further underscoring the time-consuming nature of manual image analysis. Moreover, Liu et al.[@liu2020] highlighted the time-consuming nature of manual or semi-automatic measurements in fiber length analysis, which limits the number of measurements that can be performed. These references collectively support the claim that manual analysis of medical images is time-consuming, particularly as the volume of imaging data continues to grow. The evidence suggests that the increasing volume and complexity of medical imaging data pose significant challenges for manual analysis, impacting the efficiency and scalability of image interpretation and analysis.
